      <description>Some HORSE and 2k going on in the NBA. Devin Booker beat his teamate in a 2k tournament and Trae Young played Chauncey Billips in HORSE. Devin Booker played Deandre Ayton in a 2k tournament. As you can tell if you watched the video of them playing 2k, Devin Booker was very happy winning. Deandre Ayton on the other side, had great sportsmanship, but still was kind of so-so. In HORSE, there are a lot of people saying Trae Young his very most likely going to win.</description>
