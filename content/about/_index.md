We must transform the divine power latent in you into skill, for undertaking any useful activity. When knowledge is converted into skill, you acquire balance in life. In such a state of equanimity, you will develop insight. Ennobled with such an insight and divine power, you should undertake a noble activity. Only then it will be most fruitful and beneficial to everyone. Always undertake noble activities with a pure mind. Unity brings purity, and purity in turn leads to Divinity. You should never forget the inseparable relationship between unity, purity, and Divinity, and always strive to achieve that. You must all come together and work together in the spirit of sacrifice. Spirituality is not a business activity. Spirituality is divine. Spirituality is associated with unity. This unity in diversity alone will bring you happiness. I wish that you cultivate that principle of unity. Then, every activity undertaken by you will acquire its due value and sanctity!.
